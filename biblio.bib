abstract = {For more than 35 years, the fastest known method for integer multiplication has been the Sch\"{o}nhage-Strassen algorithm running in time O(n log n log log n). Under certain restrictive conditions there is a corresponding Ω(n log n) lower bound. The prevailing conjecture has always been that the complexity of an optimal algorithm is Θ(n log n). We present a major step towards closing the gap from above by presenting an algorithm running in time n log n, 2O(log* n).The main result is for boolean circuits as well as for multitape Turing machines, but it has consequences to other models of computation as well.},

abstract = {C++11 has arrived: thoroughly master it, with the definitive new guide from C++ creator Bjarne Stroustrup, C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition! The brand-new edition of the world's most trusted and widely read guide to C++, it has been comprehensively updated for the long-awaited C++11 standard. Extensively rewritten to present the C++11 language, standard library, and key design techniques as an integrated whole, Stroustrup thoroughly addresses changes that make C++11 feel like a whole new language, offering definitive guidance for leveraging its improvements in performance, reliability, and clarity. C++ programmers around the world recognize Bjarne Stoustrup as the go-to expert for the absolutely authoritative and exceptionally useful information they need to write outstanding C++ programs. Now, as C++11 compilers arrive and development organizations migrate to the new standard, they know exactly where to turn once more: Stoustrup's C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition.}
