\section{Future outlook}
Describe the pending issues and plans for improvement:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Documentation inside boost,
    \item optimization of the Boost routines,
    \item multithreading,
    \item multidimentional transforms,
    \item to work in collaboration with Boost.MPI to create distributed memory
    transforms to tacke the $D$-dimentional scalability problem proposing a
    $D-1$ domain decomposition similar to \cite{pippig_13}.
\end{itemize}
